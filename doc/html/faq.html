    <h1>The Suvat v0.2 FAQ</h1>
    <h2>Why is there a minus sign in the velocity (or displacement, or acceleration)?</h2>
    <p>
    You might initially think that velocity and speed are the same thing,
    but there is an important difference between them. That is that they
    velocity is a vector quantity while speed is a scalar. Similarly,
    distance is a scalar and displacement is a vector.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you are not a mathematician or a physicist, that probably will not
    mean a lot. The key difference is that velocity includes direction as
    well as magnitude. One could say that a car has a speed of 50 mph, but
    to give its velocity one would have to say 50 mph <strong>North</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
    That makes sense on the two-dimensional ground, but the universe Suvat
    operates in is one dimensional (for the moment). This means that all
    motion that can be calculated in Suvat takes place along one infinitely
    long straight line. Velocity still has to include direction though, and
    direction is indicated by positive and negative numbers. Just imagine
    the line stretching out in front of you and say that going to the right
    is positive and to the left is negative. It doesn't really matter which
    way round they are, as long as you don't get confused between them.
    </p>
    <p>
    As far as distance and displacement are concerned, pick a point on
    your infinitely long straight line. This is your origin, or zero point.
    All distances are measured from this point. If they are to the right,
    they might be positive and to the left, negative (depending on which
    way round you decide + and - are).
    </p>
    <h2>Why do I have to use SI units in Suvat?</h2>
    <p>
    Because SI units (metres, seconds and so on) are the best.
    </p>
    <p>
    No really, that's why. When they were deciding on how long a second
    should be, and the size of other standard units, they realised that
    all the units in physics could be thought of in terms of 6 basic ones:
    <ul>
	<li>The kilogram (kg), the unit of mass</li>
	<li>The metre (m), the unit of length</li>
	<li>The second (s), the unit of time</li>
	<li>The ampere (A), the unit of electric current</li>
	<li>The kelvin (K), the unit of temperature</li>
	<li>The candela (cd), the unit of light intensity</li>
    </ul>
    All the other units can be thought of as combinations of these basic
    ones (eg 1 N = (1 kg) * (1 metre) / (1 second)^2). The SI units
    therefore make it possible to use the simple formulae such as F = ma
    that relate the physical quantities and have the answers come out in
    the right units.
    </p>
    <p>
    To be honest though, as the only units used in Suvat at the moment
    are metres and seconds, you can enter details in miles and hours if
    you like and have the velocities come out in mph. It's just a bit
    of a pain to work out how many miles 750 yards is.
