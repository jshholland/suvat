    <h1>Suvat, the motion simulator</h1>
    <p>
    This is the documentation for Suvat version 0.2. Suvat is a small
    application that uses the laws of motion under constant acceleration to
    calculate details of the motion of an object.
    </p>
    <p>
    But what does this actually mean? What you see when you run Suvat is a
    window with 5 labelled entry boxes and two buttons. After a small amount of
    experimentation, you will find that you are expected to enter three numbers
    and press the "Calculate" button. If the numbers make sense in a basic
    physical sense, Suvat will calculate the remaining details of motion
    and fill in the remaining entry boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
    An example might help make more sense. Say you enter the numbers as
    follows:
    <ul>
	<li>10 in "Displacement"</li>
	<li>3 in "Original velocity"</li>
	<li>7 in "Time"</li>
    </ul>
    Pressing calculate will then fill in the remaining boxes:
    <ul>
	<li>-0.142857142857 in "Final velocity"</li>
	<li>-0.448979591837 in "Acceleration"</li>
    </ul>
    These are the correct details for an object to travel 10 metres
    in 7 seconds starting with a velocity of 3 metres per second.
