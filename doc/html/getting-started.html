    <h1>Getting started</h1>

    <p>Once Suvat is installed, run it by typing <code>suvat</code> at the command prompt. The Suvat window will launch and present you with 5 entry boxes and two buttons. The interface is pretty forgiving, and you can probably work out what&#8217;s going on by experimentation.</p>
    <p>If you&#8217;re unsure of what to do, try entering 3 numbers into the entry boxes and hit &#8220;calculate&#8221;. If the numbers make sense in terms of the motion of an object, the other boxes will be filled in with the other details of the movement of the object. Otherwise, a popup will appear and tell you that the numbers you entered are invalid.</p>
