== suvat ==
suvat is a GTK based utility to calculate various details about the motion of
an object (namely its displacement, initial velocity, final velocity,
acceleration and the time taken) given other details.

The GUI is written in Python using PyGTK but the main calculation is written
in C for speed.

It is developed and tested on an Ubuntu Linux system, but should work on most
Unices.

It is licensed under the GPL version 3 and is copyright (C) 2009 Josh Holland.
