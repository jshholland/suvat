suvat uses a setup.py script. To install,
# python setup.py install
To build without installing,
$ python setup.py build

Options to the script can be found by
$ python setup.py --help
or
$ python setup.py --help-commands

To install, you should need only what you would normally need to build a C
program using the GNU gettext i18n suite, the development headers for Python
and the Python interpreter itself.  Also, you will need the python-gtk2 (or its
equivalent) package installed.
